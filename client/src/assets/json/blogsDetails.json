AR and Virtual Reality technologies are disruptive and allow for experiential digital marketing that lets businesses communicate more effectively than ever.\u00a0 Our <a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/\">digital marketing agency<\/a>\u00a0team enables you to be an early implementer and create an impact by influencing the behavior of existing customers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Why is working with virtual reality companies a must for your business?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality companies,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/\">Digipuush<\/a> and their technologies have long been under-utilised having focused mainly on gaming and entertainment systems. In the digital revolution that\u2019s overtaking business, immersive technology has become an all-important experience that has become mainstream. More businesses are realising the importance of working with virtual reality companies to develop apps, and enhance their offerings and products. Virtual reality companies enable businesses to use a wide range of applications, be it in healthcare, retail, hospitality or travel. Businesses are incorporating new technologies like AR and VR to make their processes efficient, faster, and more productive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, is there a difference between AR and VR? Although they seem to have similar concepts, they are two very different concepts. Simply put, AR is the process of adding digital elements to augment the user\u2019s experience of the real world. Pokemon Go is the most famous and well-known usage of AR in recent times. However, AR can be indispensable to businesses where consumers need to be immersed in the real world in different ways. AR enterprise solutions can include remote assistance, on-ground and hands-on training, and remote collaboration. AR can be perfect for industrial usage, and maintenance tasks, as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>VR, on the other hand, sticks to its name and plunges the user into a fictional world devoid of reality. VR allows the user to immerse in a different world that is entirely simulated with no connection to the real world. VR is best suited for training purposes, organising virtual tours, and smarter remote collaboration using 3D. Walmart, for example, uses VR extensively for training its employees through various situations including scenarios like bad weather.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality companies in India can develop AR and VR solutions that will allow users to derive a multi-sensory experience, which is not otherwise available. Businesses can have their customers touch, feel, see, hear, and smell their products to provide 360-degree engagement. AR and VR enhanced products and services would enable customers to intellectually appraise and emotionally connect with your products to make informed decisions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Here\u2019s how virtual reality development companies and their offerings can have an impact on your business<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Improve product prototypes<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality companies like ours can help you use AR and VR to improve your visualisation and design of a product that is in the development stage. Enhance precision, functionality, and usefulness by seeing what the fully developed product looks like.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality companies help you in making multiple changes to the prototype without ever having to build the real product before it\u2019s fully ready. The decision makers in your organisation can provide constructive feedback during the development, while the product is being tested and analysed virtually, which will help improve productivity and save time and effort. For example, the health technology sector is expected to expand at a CAGR of 15.9% between 2016 and 2021 as it embraces new technologies with AR and VR being two of them. Virtual reality companies are working more with the healthcare sector to improve patient care systems, operational processes, provide more affordable solutions for the future, and create risk models for more efficient care.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Leaner business systems and processes<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Having distributed teams across geographies and offices is the norm today. It\u2019s the leaner, more efficient way of working and it is technology that has made it possible. Virtual reality companies can help you take more steps to make your organisation function seamlessly by reducing communication gaps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With advanced infrastructure, you can now manage your human resources to realize their full potential. Conduct meetings, review performances, and tackle every issue without ever leaving your office.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality companies can develop the appropriate applications and enhance software and hardware in your company so that you can considerably reduce business travel, which translates into more savings. Large organisations and agile startups alike now use virtual reality companies to set up technology infrastructure for onboarding, hiring, employee education, and better communication. For instance, at Boeing, workers were able to cut assembly time by 25% by wearing AR headsets that enabled them to cut the time taken to look at a computer screen multiple times.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Enhance customer experience<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With more and more people getting access to the internet, shopping has now shifted online. E-commerce sales account for at least 14% of retail sales across the world and by 2023 e-commerce purchases are expected to jump to 22%. Engaging virtual reality companies enables you to substantially enhance customer experience by creating virtual stores for new product launches or even your entire product line. At least 77% of online shoppers make impulse purchases, which can capitalised upon with the help of virtual reality companies who can develop appropriate applications.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>VR and AR can also be used for gathering extensive data and identifying constantly shifting social trends. You can also track shopper behavior and preferences as they look at products in their entirety and make their purchasing decisions. Using virtual reality companies like ours can attract more customers with the help of an immersive sensory experience, allow you to cull precious real-time marketing insights, keep track of inventory, and adjust shelf display in seconds to suit a particular customer base.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why choose Digipuush?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Virtual reality companies like ours enable you to effectively use technology to expand the horizons of your business by influencing the behavior of existing customers as well as attracting new customers with impressive demos.

Many marketers are overwhelmed by the choices that\u00a0<em>PPC<\/em>\u00a0offers and are daunted by the spend it demands. As a marketer, you need to answer a few questions first. Do you need PPC services (pay per click services) at all? How much do you need to budget for\u00a0<strong>PPC management services<\/strong>? Are the benefits worth the expenditure?<\/p>\n<p><strong>PPC companies in India<\/strong>\u00a0like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/seo-company-in-bangalore\/\">Digipuush<\/a>\u00a0helps you arrive at a decision.

It uses data from your account to determine which ads, keywords, and campaigns have the greatest impact on your business goals.\u201d A good\u00a0<em>pay per click management campaign<\/em>\u00a0has the power to make that impact with competent professionals to interpret the data.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-color\"><strong>Sharp and hyper-focused targeting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One of the first priorities of a professional\u00a0<strong>PPC company in India<\/strong>\u00a0like ours is targeting campaigns to reach a focused audience.

SEO<\/a> We help optimize your website with the lead generation objective in mind. Today\u2019s consumers search for products \/ services online and your website can act as a lead generation machine if it ranks for keywords on the top positions of SERP\u2019s.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ab-accordion-text\">\n<p>We run through keyword research and optimize the web pages with targeted long tail keywords. This will result in increase in website traffic through the keywords, thereby generating targeted marketing leads. Often users fill in the form provided on each page to get more information about the products \/ services. For example, a page containing services offered by dentist, the use fills in the form on the landing page resulting in a lead for the dentist. Alternatively, we can provide with appointment setting lead to the dentist through\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/seo-company-in-bangalore\/\">SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/social-media-marketing-services\/\">Social Media<\/a>\u00a0A social media lead generation strategy also involves understanding which channel is the right one for your business. Perhaps your relevant audience is mostly active on Facebook and not on Instagram or perhaps they can be found on LinkedIn. Pinpointing the exact channels that suit your business right from the beginning of a social media campaign is an important aspect of lead generation services.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ab-accordion-text\">\n<p>We deploy lead generation campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn to generate leads for our clients in India and abroad. Each platform is chosen based on the target audience and the budget of client. Like if you want to target c-level executives we recommend LinkedIn platform. At the same time if you are looking for real estate leads, we recommend Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>The campaign set up in each platform is different and we have the technical expertise to extract the audience insights to execute any lead generation campaigns. Some times we also use organic methods on social media channels to generate leads. For example, optimizing YouTube videos for keywords will result in quality leads.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>3. PPC Using\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/ppc-services-pay-per-click\/\">pay per click\u00a0<\/a>(PPC) is the smart way to generate leads to your business. With good conversion rate, the spend on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/ppc-services-pay-per-click\/\">PPC<\/a>\u00a0is well justified. We create landing pages and optimize keywords for high relevance. This is the main criteria to improve the quality score of your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/ppc-services-pay-per-click\/\">PPC campaigns<\/a>. Once we appear on the top of SERP using the ad route, the user navigates to the landing page through the ad and fills the form, there by generating the lead.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ab-accordion-text\">\n<p>We create compelling landing pages optimized for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/ppc-services-pay-per-click\/\">pay per click<\/a>\u00a0campaigns. For example, an educational institute with multi city presence seeking potential candidates for MBA admissions, we use keywords like \u201cbest MBA colleges in India\u201d, \u201cTop MBA schools in Mumbai\u201d, \u201cMBA colleges in Delhi\u201d etc. in the ad campaigns. We measure CTR, Quality score, CPC, Impressions and conversions for each PPC campaign.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>4. Email marketing is the simplest and easiest way to scope out potential customers. It is also the one that can be the most impact full of all lead marketing services. It is expected that 4.3 billion people will have access to or use email by 2023, which is an exponential growth in the number of potential customers for businesses.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ab-accordion-text\">\n<p><strong>Email marketing<\/strong>\u00a0is also one of the proven methods that delivers strong returns on investment. For every dollar that is invested into email marketing it is estimated that you get at least $42 in return.\u00a0<strong>B2B lead generation services<\/strong>\u00a0like ours personalize emails to match your audience, business goals, and immediate targets to reach a wider section of the population. It is also one of the most effective tools to continue engaging a warm lead, stay on top of their minds, and convert them into a buyer when they are ready through email automation.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>5. Build a landing page Another crucial part of\u00a0<strong>B2B lead generation services<\/strong> is building a landing page. Usually, a landing page is distinctive, separate from the home page of your website, and is built with the sole purpose of advertising deals, offers, and other information that interests a potential lead.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ab-accordion-text\">\n<p>Landing pages typically feature contests, white papers, eBooks, free trials or event information in exchange for gathering a lead\u2019s contact details. Professional lead generation services like ours ensure that a landing page does its job \u2013 convert a lead to a long-term customer \u2013 by pointing them towards specific products or services.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>6. Content Marketing Lead generation is not just about racking up a list of new leads, which is easy enough to do. Top of the Funnel (ToFU) marketing is the first step towards lead generation where sales personnel make lists of potential customers and engage with them to gauge their interest.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ab-accordion-text\">\n<p><strong>B2B lead generation services<\/strong>\u00a0like ours offer deep engagement and practices Middle of the Funnel (MoFU) marketing techniques that focuses on building strong relationships and trust to transform the lead from being a potential to a loyal customer. MoFU is a critical stage in the buying journey as this is where the leads are still making up their minds on how to solve the problem they are grappling with. Experienced B2B lead generation services will seize this opportunity to offer various solutions that your business can offer in the form of videos or webinars to convince leads that their problem can be addressed.<\/p>\n<p>But what happens after your leads get more interested and are thinking of a purchase? This is where Bottom of the Funnel (BoFU) marketing comes in. As crucial as the previous stage, BoFU is the point where your customer is ready to buy your products or services but is still comparing your offerings with that of competitors. Continuous engagement and consultations with the lead should be a part of lead generation services through marketing tools like case studies, live demos, and trial offers to ensure that the lead arrives at a decision favorable to you.<\/p>\n<p>Following the ToFU, MoFU, and BoFU stages to perfection is crucial for successful\u00a0<strong>B2B lead generation<\/strong>\u00a0with the focus being on educating and informing rather than marketing and selling. With every potential customer being only a few clicks away from deciding in favor of your competitors it is important that lead generation services adapt to the changing buying journey. Allocating more budgets to\u00a0<strong>lead generation<\/strong>\u00a0is well and good but it only gives you returns in the truest sense when you have gained not just more sales but customers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p> B2B Lead Generation Services in India for your Business Digipuush \u2013\u00a0Digital marketing agency, specializes in B2B\u00a0lead generation services\u00a0that gives measurable sales outcomes and ROI.

These may come forward in the names of awareness, considerations, and the objectives for the brand. Objectives can have a severe impact on the promotions considering the advertising cost.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frankly speaking, the simplest brand promotion will be cheaper than landing sales. Similarly, the clicks will be cheaper in comparison to the conversions. It will be better to finalize a plan in this regard to increase sales.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Competition for Facebook ads<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There stands the simplest economics of supply and demand in this regard. In case, not any business approaches your specific target audience, the\u00a0<strong>Facebook advertising cost<\/strong>\u00a0will fall automatically.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This cost will be directly proportional to the total number of competitors you are getting for the same. In case there comes across a huge number of competitors, the costing will be higher. Moreover, the costs also depend upon the competitor\u2019s spending ability and the relevance rates.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Advertising period<\/strong>:<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Either we consider the\u00a0<strong>Facebook page promotion cost in India<\/strong>, or abroad, the time of advertising directly impacts the costing. The holiday seasons in India raise the\u00a0<strong>Facebook ads cost<\/strong>\u00a0and similar will be the condition for abroad as well. During the festive seasons like Christmas etc, the costing increases a lot.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, we need to cleverly select the weekdays and even the hours to remain economical. Avoid going for peak times and enjoy the rate cut for advertising purposes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Facebook Ads placement affecting the cost<\/strong>:<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The<strong>\u00a0Facebook advertising cost in India\u00a0<\/strong>and even abroad depends upon the different ad placement techniques. The costing varies completely as per the placement techniques.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every single ad placement technique has different lead generation capabilities. Similar to running the Google ads ad campaign, we need to move forward with Facebook ads also.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Facebook page promotion cost in India<\/strong>, and even outside has to do a lot with ad placement techniques. The ad placement can be done in several forms including the following: &#8211;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Feeds Instant Articles<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Marketplace<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stories<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Right Column<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In-stream video.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Facebook Messenger<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Audience Network, etc<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Relevance Score<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Relevance score is a kind of the Facebook metric showing the relevancy of the ads to the audience. It analyzes the user\u2019s engagement with the ads and their interest concerning it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case the ads start getting the click and the audience gets engaged, the relevance scores increase. The\u00a0<strong>Facebook ads cost\u00a0<\/strong>is proportionate to this score. Consequently, if the users start choosing, \u2018<em>this ad is not relevant to me\u2019,\u00a0<\/em>the score decrease automatically.\u00a0\u00a0 The highest relevance score gets assistance from the Facebook algorithm. Even the costing for the ads becomes less for similar placement mechanisms.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/section>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"wp-block-uagb-section uagb-section__wrap uagb-section__background-color alignfull uagb-block-4b384900-0de1-4050-bcb4-7bf663131762\">\r\n<div class=\"uagb-section__overlay\">\u00a0<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"uagb-section__inner-wrap\">\r\n<h2><strong>Proven Strategies to Reduce Facebook Ads Cost<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Targeting an appropriate audience base for better engagement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the Facebook audience overlap tool and remove the overlapping functions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using Facebook Pixels for tracking the audience conversion rates, etc.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Executing multiple ads within the same invested budget.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individually analyzing the ads graph including user engagement.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Utilizing the aspects of retargeting segments.

While there are many similarities between traditional marketing and <em><a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/\">digital marketing<\/a><\/em>, there are also key differences that can make the difference between a winning campaign that allows you to earn money and a losing campaign that leads nowhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>First step, traditional marketing and <strong>digital marketing<\/strong> are not that different before doing something. You must first clearly identify and define your target market and who you are trying to reach. This is crucial because your target market will determine how it is advertised, where it is advertised and what is advertised. For example, you&#8217;re going to want to use a very different message to sell to a 63-year-old grandmother who loves gardening and lives in Bengaluru and to a 22-year-old man who recently graduated from college, likes Music, and lives in Delhi. These markets are likely to respond to completely different images and messages, also they are likely to hang out in different places online. Defining them clearly first allows you to target them better. It saves you time and money by not marketing to people who probably don&#8217;t care what you offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second step, which is to create content that is liked by the platform like <a href=\"https:\/\/digipuush.com\/social-media-marketing-services\/\">YouTube<\/a>. Create content that others create, regardless of the platform they use, then leverage and create content that you feel is right. Now there is an important note here, no matter what content you create, whether it&#8217;s an ad or an article instead of an image, you should draw a thin line between sitting in and standing out. This way of describing is that you want your content to stand out, but for the right reasons, not because it seems like it doesn&#8217;t belong there. Some examples of multimedia content that stand out would be taking great photos of unique products or brands for Instagram. Writing attractive and engaging articles on LinkedIn. Keeping your Facebook friendly, social and human. Keeping your tweets on Twitter short and attractive. Be sure to always send a clear and consistent brand message so that your results become more complicated over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite things about <strong>digital marketing<\/strong> is the ability to track the performance of your campaign. Unlike <em>traditional marketing<\/em>, we really don&#8217;t know how many people have seen your message or done something about it. With <em>digital marketing <\/em>you can measure everything, in fact there are too much Information. That&#8217;s why we almost always suggest simplifying it as much as possible, which generally allows us to narrow it down to a key metric to monitor. If your goal is to get people to see your message, the metric is the impressions remembered, that is, the number of times you have shown it. If your goal is to get more clicks on your website&#8217;s landing page or in your shopping cart, you can measure it with Google Analytics. If your primary goal is to get users to take action online, take a look at the conversion metrics. Whether it&#8217;s conversions, calls, clicks, or visits to key pages, the best way to start is to choose one and then measure the performance continuously. You can find ways to change or upgrade over time.<\/p>\n\n\n<\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Grow your business with digital marketing as traditional marketing is fading away with modern marketing technology and trends.
